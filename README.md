netbox-portal is a lightweight, Django-based customer portal for service providers using
[Netbox](https://www.github.com/netbox-community/netbox) as an operational support system (OSS). The basic goal is to
provide an interface to relevant records from Netbox to customers without having to enable access to Netbox and the
internal network itself.
